**Code Repo** is where you can upload and store your test projects for your Katalon Studio test execution via [TestOps Cloud](grid-testops-cloud.html) and [Local Agents](grid-local-agents.html). 

### To upload your test projects 

1. In your **Project** view, select **Code Repo**. This page will show you all the uploaded projects. 

2. Upload your test project as a zip file from your local machine. If you store your code in a code repository such as Github, you can download the project zip package from Github. When it is fully uploaded, the project will be presented under the **Test Projects** section.
