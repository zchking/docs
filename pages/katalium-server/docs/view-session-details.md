> This feature is only available in Grid mode.

Katalium Grid Hub will automatically capture screenshots of browsers started by its Grid Node. This will help you monitor on-going sessions and debug test execution errors. All sessions are stored in the directory `<user_home>/katalon-selenium`.

## View all sessions

To see the list of all sessions, go to `http://hub_grid:4444/grid/admin/KatalonConsole/index.html`.

For example:

## Clean up old sessions

Katalium Grid Hub schedules a daily job to clean up sessions older than two months.
