## Grid mode

### Grid Hub

To start the server as a Grid Hub, execute `hub.sh` file (in macOS and Linux) or `hub.bat` file (in Windows).

```
cd katalium-server
hub.bat
```

```
cd katalium-server
chmod u+x ./hub.sh
```

See **Standalone mode** for activation steps.

### Grid Node

To start the server as a Grid Node, execute `node.sh` file (in macOS and Linux) or `node.bat` file (in Windows). Before executing the scripts, please set the Hub URL in `nodeConfigForWindow.json` (for Windows) or `nodeConfig.json` (for macOS and Linux) so that Grid Nodes can register themselves with the above Grid Hub, e.g. `http://hub_ip:4444`.

```
cd katalium-server
node.bat
```

```
cd katalium-server
chmod u+x ./node.sh
```

See **Standalone mode** for activation steps.
