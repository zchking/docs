## Execution

Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, you can test your mobile applications on such custom cloud devices as Sauce Labs, BrowserStack,..

Katalon Studio supports running a Mobile script on both remote and custom cloud devices.

> Notes: Generate Command dialog doesn't require the **Remote Server URL** and **Remote Server Type**, Katalon Studio uses the current settings of Remote execution.

## Mobile Object Spy and  Mobile Recorder

Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, *Mobile Object Spy* and *Mobile Recorder* are available on remote devices (not custom devices).

### Remote Devices

In addition to Android, iOS and Kobiton devices, a new tool item **Remote Devices** is added to the UI of Mobile Object Spy and  Mobile Recorder.
