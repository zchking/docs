## Katalon Studio Supported Environment on macOS

* Appium: 1.12.1 onwards
* Android: 6.x onwards
* iOS: 9.x onwards

> Attention
> 
> Some emulators have already supported Appium through their installations. Thus, if you want to run an application on an emulator, check you emulator's settings before proceeding with Appium installation.

## Android

### Required components

If you want to test an Android application on your local device. You will need to install [Appium](http://appium.io). The basic steps are:

* Install NodeJS

### Setting up the devices

*   Turn on the phone's developer mode (go to **Settings** > **Developer options**).
*   Connect your Android Phone to your computer via a USB cable. Just confirm if prompted to accept/trust the device.
*   Install Android SDK: Katalon Studio will detect and ask you to install Android SDK automatically if your current machine doesn't have it. Please allow Katalon Studio to install it in this case.

### Verify

After completing setting your environment, open a Mobile Testing Sample Project (which is packaged in your Katalon Studio installation) and execute a test suite using an Android device:
