There will be cases in which you want to schedule your tests to execute within a period or every x hours. Katalon Studio does not support scheduler, but you can schedule executions using the steps below:

1.  Create a batch/shell file (.bat / .sh) to execute your test suite using Console Mode Execution
2.  Schedule your script as required in Task Scheduler (Windows) or cronjob (Linux / MacOSX )
