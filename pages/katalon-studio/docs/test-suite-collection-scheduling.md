The **Next run** field will contain the date of the upcoming execution of this test suite collection.

If you want to reschedule, you just need to input a new time and hit **Schedule** again. A pop-up will inform you that the old schedule will be overrided.

Now the test suite collection will be executed at the updated time.

#### Import from Postman:

First export your Postman collection to JSON. See the instruction [here](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#exporting-and-importing-postman-data). 

Then in Katalon Studio, create a new API/Web Service project (currently the only type of project supporting this Postman collection import feature), and click on Postman icon on the toolbar.
