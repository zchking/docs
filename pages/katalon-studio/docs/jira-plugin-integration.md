If your test cases have already been linked to a JIRA ticket, Katalon Studio will not sync them again.

## Import BDD Feature Files

**Jira Integration** also allows you to import Jira BDD Feature Files to Katalon Studio.

When importing test cases from Jira, please check **Link to BDD Feature File** &gt; **OK** &gt; Choose the destination to store the issues.

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/sample.png)

A new Feature File (with the same name as the test case) will be created with the content from Jira BDD. Moreover, a RunFeature step will be created in the linked test case to Jira.

## View Test Results on Jira

After you have successfully integrated test cases, test execution results will be automatically created in the associated Jira ticket. Review the status and attachments of Katalon Studio test cases right inside Jira.
