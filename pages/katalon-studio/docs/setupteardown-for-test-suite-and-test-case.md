Every test suite from your projects now has been equipped with the ability to run either **SetUp** or **Teardown** methods, which are groups of your own defined test steps before or after executing a Test Suite. This feature is another great extension besides [Test Listener](https://docs.katalon.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5126383) to extend your current testing flow as much as possible.

There will a **new tab** called '**Script**' in **Test Suite**'s interface. This interface will generate sample **Setup** and **TearDown** methods to be used.

How it works
------------

By default, these **Setup** and **Teardown** methods will not be triggered even if they match with provided trigger condition above. You need to **set skipped value from false** to true to activate related methods.

Methods consideration
---------------------

*   Execution progress from these methods still have execution logs as usual and they will be stored in execution logs files of Katalon Studio.
    
*   You can't see setUp and teardown executed reports from generated Test Suite report. Only **setUpTestCase** and **tearDownTestCase** can be seen in generated Test Suite report
*   Test Listeners will always be triggered first if you define both Test Listeners and activate Setup / Teardown methods at the same time.
