# API Keys usage 


In Katalon Studio Commandline Execution, API keys play the role as the user credentials to download and install plugins of the API key owners to Katalon Studio before proceeding execution. 

Without API keys applied, Katalon Studio will execute as no plugins are installed. Therefore, API keys are must-have for using plugin functions during Commandline Execution in Katalon Studio.


# Manage API Keys


## Create a new key



1.  Navigate to Katalon Store **[My Account](https://store.katalon.com/account)** > **Security** tab.
1.  Click on **Generate Key** button > Input key **Title** > Click **Add key** button > Key list will be shown with the new key added.


## Remove an existing key



1.  Navigate to Katalon Store **[My Account](https://store.katalon.com/account)** > **Security** tab.
2.  Click on the **Remove** button of the key you want to remove > Click **OK** to remove

Note that this action cannot be undone. Once a key is removed, it cannot be used anymore.
