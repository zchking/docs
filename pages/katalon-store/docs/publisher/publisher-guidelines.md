**_Note 4: Do not use Katalon-owned illustrations, icons, or other brand assets._**



## Plugin's name in Store

- All of plugin names are written in **title case**. That means **each letter** except the first letter in the name is **lowercase**. All references to our products in text must utilize the proper case.



   Example:

  DYNAMIC FILTERING TEST SUITE ⇒ Dynamic Filtering Test Suite

  Dynamic filtering test suite ⇒ Dynamic Filtering Test Suite

- Use names that describe what your plugin does or that match your brand. 
- Don't use names that seem to indicate the plugin is built by Katalon. Your plugin name should never start with a Katalon product name (Katalon Studio). Instead, use the following pattern: **[Your plugin]** for **[Katalon Studio]**. 


  **Examples of approved names:**

  Dynamic Filtering Test Suite for Katalon Studio

  Themes for Katalon Studio
 
  **Examples of NOT approved names:**

  Katalon Studio Bug Fixer

  Katalon Studio Themes
